## 🗓️ Phase Breakdown & Gateway Verification

### Phase 1: Foundation & Database Architecture
- [x] Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript setup
- [x] Vanilla CSS Modules Dark Gaming Design Tokens (`globals.css`)
- [x] Supabase Postgres Database Schema (`001_initial_schema.sql`)
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all 7 tables
- [x] BGIS Scoring Engine & Constants (`lib/scoring.ts`)
- [x] Supabase Server & Client SDK bindings (`lib/supabase/*`)

#### 🛡️ Phase 1 Gateway Checks:
- [x] **Type Safety:** 0 TypeScript compiler errors.
- [x] **Database Integrity:** Foreign key constraints, CASCADE deletes, and UUID primary keys.
- [x] **Security Gate:** RLS enabled on all tables; users can only read/write authorized rows.

---

### Phase 2: Auth (OTP) & Team/Squad Onboarding
- [x] 2-Step Email OTP Login flow (`/login`)
- [x] Auth middleware session refresh & route protection (`middleware.ts`)
- [x] Captain Team Creation with auto-generated 8-character `invite_code`
- [x] Player Squad Joining via invite code (`/onboard`)
- [x] Team Dashboard (`/dashboard`) with roster list, room IDs, coupons, and UPI ID setting

#### 🛡️ Phase 2 Gateway Checks:
- [x] **User Experience:** Smooth 2-step OTP UX with resend countdown timer.
- [x] **Security Gate:** Route protection blocks unauthenticated users from `/dashboard` and `/onboard`.
- [x] **Mobile Responsiveness:** Dashboard grid adapts dynamically to mobile viewports.

---

### Phase 3: Slot Booking & Razorpay Payment Integration
- [x] Calendar Slot Listing grouped by date with visual capacity fill bars (`/register`)
- [x] Free Slot Coupon waiver application
- [x] Server-side Razorpay Order API (`/api/payment/create-order`)
- [x] Client-side Razorpay Checkout SDK popup modal (`RegisterClient.tsx`)
- [x] Client-side HMAC SHA-256 Signature Verification (`/api/payment/verify`)
- [x] Async Razorpay Webhook listener (`/api/payment/webhook`)
- [x] DB Trigger `trigger_slot_booking_count` auto-increments booked team count
- [x] Post-booking WhatsApp Community redirect button

#### 🛡️ Phase 3 Gateway Checks:
- [x] **Payment Security:** Secret keys kept server-side; signatures verified using HMAC SHA-256.
- [x] **Concurrency Safety:** SQL triggers handle race conditions on slot capacity limits.
- [x] **User Experience:** Instant confirmation upon successful Razorpay popup closure.

---

### Phase 4: Live Leaderboard & Best-16 Scoring Engine
- [x] SQL View `leaderboard` with Best-16 limit calculation logic
- [x] BGIS Point Matrix (10-pt placement system + 1 pt per kill)
- [x] Public Live Leaderboard page (`/leaderboard`)
- [x] Desktop table with click-to-expand match breakdown (highlights Best-16 matches in gold)
- [x] Mobile card list with tap-to-expand detailed stats
- [x] Top 16 qualification badges for Grand Finals

#### 🛡️ Phase 4 Gateway Checks:
- [x] **Performance Gate:** Leaderboard view pre-calculates standings in Postgres; revalidates every 60s.
- [x] **Mobile Responsiveness:** Seamless transition between desktop table and touch-optimized mobile cards.
- [x] **Data Integrity:** Highlights exact top-16 match scores while retaining full match history.

---

### Phase 5: Granular Admin Panel & Operational Tools
- [x] Dual-role admin gate (`admin` vs `admin_scores`)
- [x] **Score Admin (`admin_scores`):** Dedicated access to Match Score Entry tab only
- [x] **Super Admin (`admin`):** Access to all 7 tabs:
  - 📊 Score Entry (Placement & Kill point calculator)
  - 📅 Slot Management (Create slots, publish Room ID/PW, mark completed)
  - 💸 Payout Log (View 1st/2nd place UPI payouts, mark as paid)
  - 📋 Bookings Log
  - 🎟️ Coupons Log
  - ⚙️ Platform Config (Edit Grand Finals date, WhatsApp link, entry fee)
  - 👥 User & Role Manager (Delegate `admin_scores` or `admin` roles)

#### 🛡️ Phase 5 Gateway Checks:
- [x] **Role Security:** RLS policies and server-side redirects enforce strict role segregation.
- [x] **Operational Efficiency:** Auto-calculation of placement + kill points reduces manual data entry errors.
- [x] **Mobile Usability:** Admin sidebar converts to a clean horizontal tab bar on mobile screens.

---

### Phase 6: Quality Gateways, SEO & Netlify Deployment
- [x] SEO Meta tags & Open Graph tags for `battlegroundsfaceoffseries.com`
- [x] Root layout with Orbitron, Rajdhani, and Inter Google Fonts
- [x] Server wrappers (`dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`) on all dynamic routes
- [x] Production Netlify deployment configuration (`netlify.toml`)
- [x] Next.js build verification (`npm run build` completed with **0 errors**)

#### 🛡️ Phase 6 Gateway Checks:
- [x] **Build Verification:** `npm run build` succeeds cleanly across all 9 dynamic routes.
- [x] **SEO Compliance:** Valid `metadataBase`, Open Graph titles, and semantic HTML structure.
- [x] **Deployment Readiness:** Environment variables and Netlify plugin configured.
